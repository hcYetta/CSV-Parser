Using 'make' to build the program.('make clean' to remove the program)

Firstly, the user is asked to give an input .csv file that he/she would like to analyze.

Following the instructions given by the command line:
choose 1 for arithmetic operations(+,-,*,/) on two columns.
-if chosen, specify the first column, operation and the second column. i.e.'col1 + col2'. The result will be stored in a file named 'col1+col2'  
choose 2 for stats on a given column
- if chosen, then specify the following four computations (min, max, median, mean) with a column. i.e.'min col1', 'max col1', 'med col1', 'avg col2'.
choose 3 for join operations
- if chosen, then speicify one col from the current file that has been read, inner/outer operation, and the col from another file. i.e. 'col1 inner col1', 'col2 outer col2'(noticing that the joined table will be stored in a corresponding file with filename 'col1innercol1' or 'col2outercol2' for the examples given here).
- then specify the filename for the second input file.
choose 4 to exit the program.

Please notice that:
1. when specifying column index, please use the zero based convention.
2. Data with different types are not allowed for any join operations.
3. Column stat(min, max, median, mean) is only valid for int or float data.
